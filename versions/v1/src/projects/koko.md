<!-- excerpt start -->

This is a [website](https://kokohii.com/) I built for my love 💖 using [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/)

<!-- excerpt end -->

## The problem

My partner is a professional UI UX designer and was looking for something to spice up her portfolio and I've wanted a project to try out [VueJs](https://vuejs.org/).

## The solution

She built the wireframes and designs in Figma first which made it really easy for me to plan out the components and essentially just follow the wireframe to build it with Vue3!

## The outcome

An impressive responsive portfolio website for an amazing designer!

Plus the Google Lighthouse 💡🏠 score is pretty good out of the box:
