<p>This website was one of the last projects I worked on for <a href="https://infinitilab.com">InifinitiLab</a>, an IT consultancy that I had the pleasure to be a part of from May 2018 to Aug 2020.
It was built from scratch using ASP.NET Core and Angular.</p>
<!-- excerpt end -->
<h2>The problem</h2>
<p>This website was a main part of the rebranding initiative that InfinitiLab was undergoing at the time.
The main focus point was to revamp their website to a more contemporary modern look, in order to attract both prospective clients and to hire new talent.
We wanted to organise the website in a way that was easy to consume while also informative to the user.</p>
<h2>The solution</h2>
<p>The <strong>first step</strong> in this process was deciding on a general layout for each of the sections within the website. So we decided on what content we want to display for each section and decided on the purposes for each of the pages.</p>
<p>For example: we knew that we wanted to make an impact on the landing page, in order to pull the viewer in and encourage them to explore more of the website. We achieved this by showcasing a fullscreen banner image with rotating text to capture the user's attention while being straight to the point.</p>
<p>The pages we decided on were the tried and tested:</p>
<ul>
<li>Home</li>
<li>Portfolio</li>
<li>About</li>
<li>Career</li>
<li>Contact</li>
</ul>
<h4>Portfolio</h4>
<p>We wanted a way to showcase the kind of things that we could do for any new clients. This resulted in a grid layout of each project's case studies that provides an at-a-glance view for people to navigate with.</p>
<p><img src="../../assets/images/il-portfolio-1.png" alt="portfolio"></p>
<p>The cool thing about this section was the way we input the content. Instead of having static html pages for each case study, I created a standard component layout that all the projects followed, and took JSON as an input.
This makes it very easy for us to maintain the list of projects and introduces an opportunity to create a simple Content Management System in the future.</p>

<h2>The outcome</h2>
<p>The revamped website was a resounding success, after publishing the new website we got many prospective client emails and fresh graduates or interns applying for the jobs listed.</p>

<h4>Some of what I learned:</h4>
<p>This project was a very front-end design focused project that allowed me to experiment with and implement
a bunch of styling best practices in terms that include things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>font-sizes</li>
<li>8px grid system</li>
<li>responsive screen sizes</li>
<li>optimised images using webp</li>
<li>photoshop</li>
</ul>
