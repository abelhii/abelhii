Originally, I built this website as a way to showcase my experience and also as a test to myself to build something great using only vanilla javascript, html and css.
Now I am using it as a way to test out new technologies such as `eleventy`.

## The problem

I wanted to create a personal website to show off the things that I have worked on!

## The solution

This website is a lot more visual and focused on design than my previous projects which was also a good way to test my knowledge of UI/UX design.
I am still evolving this site and will continue to as long as I keep finding new technologies I want to try out.

> Currently I am testing out eleventy which is a static site generator.

## The outcome

What I've learned (so far):

-   CSS scroll snap
-   CSS grid
-   JavaScript modules
-   Eleventy
-   Markdown
