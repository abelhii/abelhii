<!-- excerpt start -->
I originally built this website as a way to showcase my experience and also as a test to myself to build something great using only vanilla javascript, html and css.
<!-- excerpt end -->

It has since evolved into a playground that I'm using as a way to play with new technologies that I come across such as `Eleventy` and `Greensock`.

## The problem

I wanted to create a personal website to show off the things that I have worked on!

## The solution

This website is a lot more visual and focused on design than my previous projects which was also a good way to test my knowledge of UI/UX design.
I am still evolving this site and will continue to as long as I keep finding new technologies I want to try out.

## The outcome

#### What I've learned (so far):

| Technology                                                                                  | Description                                                                    |
