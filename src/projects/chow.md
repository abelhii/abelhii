This is a personal project I took on to improve my knowledge in Angular and mobile design.

## The problem

A conversation with a friend:

<ul style="list-style:none; line-height:1.5em; padding-left: 1em;">
    <li>"You hungry?"</li>
    <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Yes, what should we eat"</li>
    <li>"I don't know"</li>
    <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Me too"</li>
</ul>

## The solution

The idea was simple, build something that would help people decide on what to eat. Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location and if the user doesn't like the chosen option, they can ask for another option.

## The outcome

An app that enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't normally try, which in turn, generates traffic to more obscure local restaurants which, I hope, can help to enrich local communities.

[Check out the app](https://chow.abelhii.com/) and let me know what you think!
