<!-- excerpt start -->
Stamp n Go was a CSR initiative by my company, InfinitiLab to give back to the community.
I volunteered to do this project along with my boss, during the early stages of COVID-19 as I
wanted to contribute to the efforts of flattening the curve.

## The Problem

At the time of development, the Malaysian government had announced that all businesses are
required to keep a record of everyone that enters their premises, in order to keep track of
COVID clusters. Businesses were keeping track of people with pen and paper, which was incovenient
and is a hazard on its own which also makes it difficult to identify if someone gets sick.

## The Solution

The idea was simple, build something convenient that would help people "check in" to the business,
and at the same time keep a record of everyone within the same premises at particular times.
It was important for us to make sure that user's data would be kept private and only be shown to the appropriate
authorities when requested. So that if someone were diagnosed with COVID, we could provide the relevant user data to the
authorities where they can see where the person has visited and contact the people that were close to the infected person at the time; to inform them that they were exposed to COVID 19 and to self quarantine for the recommended time.

## The outcome

An easy way for users to check in to businesses. To date, more than 4000 users are checking in to businesses using Stamp n Go everyday.
