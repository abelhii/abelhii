                                This is a personal project I took on to improve my knowledge in Angular and mobile design.
                                <br>A few notes for how this came to be:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I don't cook</li>
                                    <li>I don't know what to eat</li>
                                    <li>I never know what to eat</li>
                                </ol>
                                The idea was simple, build something to help me choose what to eat;
                                <br>Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location and if the user doesn't like
                                the chosen option, they can ask for another option.
                                <br>This idea enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't normally try, which in
                                turn, generates more traffic to more unknown restaurants.

                                This was my final year project where I created a timetable / map web app for my university
                                campus.
                                The idea was to have students upload their lecture timetable into the app and it will
                                populate the map
                                with where their next classes were.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was potential for this idea, where it could also be used for things outside of the
                                university campus.
                                Where users could connect it to their own personal calendars (granted their events had
                                locations) and it would be
                                populated onto the map based on the times they had to be there.
                                <br> During my summer internship with my university, I was given the opportunity to
                                explore a little bit of this idea.
