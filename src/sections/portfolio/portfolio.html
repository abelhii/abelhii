                            This is a personal project I took on to improve my knowledge in Angular and mobile design.
                            <br>A few notes for how this came to be:
                            <ol>
                                <li>I don't cook</li>
                                <li>My friends don't cook</li>
                                <li>I never know what to eat</li>
                            </ol>
                            The idea was simple, build something to help people choose what to eat.
