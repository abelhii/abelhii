                                A conversation with a friend:
                                <ul style="list-style:none; line-height:1.5em; padding-left: 1em;">
                                    <li>"You hungry?"</li>
                                    <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Yes, what should we eat"</li>
                                    <li>"I don't know"</li>
                                    <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Me too"</li>
                                </ul>
                            </p>
                            <h3>The solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                The idea was simple, build something that would help people decide on what to eat.
                                Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location and if the user
                                doesn't like
                                the chosen option, they can ask for another option.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The outcome</h3>
                            <p>
                                An app that enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't normally try, which in
                                turn, generates traffic to more obscure local restaurants which, I hope, can help
                                to enrich local communities.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                This was for my final year project where I created a timetable-map web app for my
                                university campus.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The problem</h3>
                            <p>
                                My university had a relatively big campus, which was pretty confusng to navigate,
                                especially as a new student.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                The idea was to have students upload their lecture timetable into the app and it will
                                populate the map with where their next classes were. This required me to build a custom
                                Excel parser (in PHP), to parse the data into JSON in order to insert the student's
                                timetable into the calendar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It could also be used for things outside of the university campus. Where users could
                                connect it to their own personal calendars (granted their calendar events had locations
                                to them) and it would be populated onto the map based on the times they had to be there.
                                <br> I was given the opportunity to explore a little bit more of this idea during my
                                summer internship with my university.
                            </p>

                                was also a good way to test my knowledge of UI/UX design.
