                                This is a personal project I took on to improve my knowledge in Angular and mobile
                                design.
                                <br><br>A few notes for how this came to be:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>I don't cook</li>
                                    <li>I don't know what to eat</li>
                                    <li>I never know what to eat</li>
                                </ol>
                                The idea was simple, build something to help me choose what to eat;
                                <br>Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location and if the user
                                doesn't like
                                the chosen option, they can ask for another option.
                                <br>This idea enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't normally try, which in
                                turn, generates more traffic to more unknown local restaurants. I believe this app can
                                help to enrich local communities.

                            <h2>Time Map</h2>
                            <div class="technology">google api, bootstrap, php, javascript, html, css</div>
                            <p>
                                This was for my final year project where I created a timetable / map web app for my
                                university campus.
                                The idea was to have students upload their lecture timetable into the app and it will
                                populate the map with where their next classes were.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There was potential for this idea; where it could be used for things outside of the
                                university campus. Where users could connect it to their own personal calendars (granted
                                their events had locations) and it would be populated onto the map based on the times
                                they had to be there.
                                <br> I was given the opportunity to explore a little bit more of this idea, during my
                                summer internship with my university.

                                I built this website as a way to showcase my experience and also as a test to myself to
                                use only vanilla javascript, html and css. This website is a lot more visual and focused
                                on design than my previous projects which was also a good way to test my UI/UX design.
                                <br><br>Techniques used for this project:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>CSS scroll snap</li>
                                    <li>CSS grid</li>
                                    <li>Javascript modules</li>
                                </ul>
