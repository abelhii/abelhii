                                Stamp n Go was a CSR initiative by my company, InfinitiLab to give back to the community. 
                                I volunteered to do this project along with my boss, during the early stages of COVID-19 as I
                                wanted to contribute to the efforts of flattening the curve.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The problem</h3>
                            <p>
                                At the time of development, the Malaysian government had announced that all businesses are
                                required to keep a record of everyone that enters their premises, in order to keep track of
                                COVID clusters. Businesses were keeping track of people with pen and paper, which was incovenient 
                                and is a hazard on its own which also makes it difficult to identify if someone gets sick.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                The idea was simple, build something convenient that would help people "check in" to the business, 
                                and at the same time keep a record of everyone within the same premises at particular times.
                                It was important for us to make sure that user's data would be kept private and only be shown to the appropriate
                                authorities when requested. So that if someone were diagnosed with COVID, we could provide the relevant user data to the
                                authorities where they can see where the person has visited and contact the people that were close to the infected person at the time;
                                to inform them that they were exposed to COVID 19 and to self quarantine for the recommended time.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The outcome</h3>
                            <p>
                                An easy way for users to check in to businesses. 
                                To date, more than 4000 users are checking in to businesses using Stamp n Go everyday.

                            A conversation with a friend:
                            <ul style="list-style:none; line-height:1.5em; padding-left: 1em;">
                                <li>"You hungry?"</li>
                                <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Yes, what should we eat"</li>

                                <li style="margin-left:3em;">"Me too"</li>
                            </ul>
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The idea was simple, build something that would help people decide on what to eat.
                                Chow chooses a random eatery nearby the user's current location and if the user
                                doesn't like
                                the chosen option, they can ask for another option.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The outcome</h3>
                            <p>
                                An app that enables users to explore restaurants they wouldn't normally try, which in
                                turn, generates traffic to more obscure local restaurants which, I hope, can help
                                to enrich local communities.

                                This was for my final year project where I created a timetable-map web app for my
                                university campus.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The problem</h3>
                            <p>
                                My university had a relatively big campus, which was pretty confusng to navigate,
                                especially as a new student.
                            </p>
                            <h3>The solution</h3>
                            <p>
                                The idea was to have students upload their lecture timetable into the app and it will
                                populate the map with where their next classes were. This required me to build a custom
                                Excel parser (in PHP), to parse the data into JSON in order to insert the student's
                                timetable into the calendar.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It could also be used for things outside of the university campus. Where users could
                                connect it to their own personal calendars (granted their calendar events had locations
                                to them) and it would be populated onto the map based on the times they had to be there.
                                <br> I was given the opportunity to explore a little bit more of this idea during my
                                summer internship with my university.
